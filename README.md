A Markov chain based infinite story generator in python without extra libraries

see more on markov chains on [brilliant.org site](https://brilliant.org/wiki/markov-chains/)
and see its graphical simulation on [this site of University of Auckland](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~wild/MarkovChains/)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The dataset/bad may consist of some explicit offensive content. @rvcgeeks is never involved in generation of such material.
This material is courtsey to [textfiles.com](http://textfiles.com). Viewers view at their own discretion. No offense intended.

```
python textgen.py [text file names] (chaining order) ['p' if show Markov chain in json file else any char]
```
this story generator requires some previous stories in txt files from which it can generate 
appropiate text indefinitely. There may be no flow to the story but can generate seemingly 
hilarious ;) content given such text files. A sample run is set up in run.sh which can be run in bash
to generate story from given dataset.

```
$ ./run.sh
 generating from files : ['dataset/good/Dracula.txt', 'dataset/good/Peter Pan.txt', 'dataset/good/The adventures of Sherlock homes.txt', 'dataset/bad/Acres of Diamond.txt', 'dataset/bad/Cousins A family love fantasy.txt', "dataset/bad/Eager Beaver's Sorority Initiation.txt", 'dataset/bad/Fallen Angel.txt', 'dataset/bad/Sally And Duke.txt', 'dataset/bad/Summer Fun.txt', 'dataset/bad/The Weekend Captive.txt', 'dataset/bad/Twice the Fun.txt']
